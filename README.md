# React + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` then

### `yarn start`

**Note**

This product displays product catalog, with ability to filter item by key name and filter by product categories.
A user can add to cart by clicking on each of the product which naviagtes to details page but if you aren't signed in, you can't login

I have provided a default login account provided by [https://fakestoreapi.com/docs], this is because when a user signs up using [https://fakestoreapi.com/docs] the data isn't recorded, The signup process can be done but note that user won't be stored to a database and this is why a default login credentials is provided for test.

**Note**

> You can use any of the users' username and password available in users API to get token. any other usernames return error.
